### CMSI 1010 Computer Programming & Laboratory, Fall 2025
# Your Lab Repository
Welcome to your lab repository or repo for short! Here, you will submit all the labs that we will work on in class.

## To add a lab
On your device in VSCode, create a new file in this repository. (If you are seeing this on your computer, you're probably already there!) Name the file after the lab! Lab01 should be lab01.py
>Also no spaces in the name! 

## To work on a lab
Each lab will have it's instructions posted [here](https://github.com/LMU-Douglas/lab-instructions). More labs will be posted as the semester continues. They will have a small review of the content at the top, then a table with each problem you'll have to complete, and finally the instructions for the problems themself. As the semester continues, new topics will build on older ones.

Make sure each part of the lab is coded in **the same file**. This means no lab04_part1.py or lab11_question2.py. One lab, one file. 

## To submit a lab
Use the commands below to help submit each lab. (Make sure you change the file name and commit message accordingly)

```bash
git add lab00.py
git commit -m "<insert message here>"
git push
```

For more detailed instructions, check out your lab00!

> If you're getting an error and your terminal is saying 'This is not a git repository', make sure you're in your repo! `cd` all day!


## Credit
Most of the labs were provided and designed by Dr. Korpusik and Dr. Yazdensepas.

My TAs Gray, Jacob, CJ, Colin, and Aiden M. all assisted in the rewrites and redesign to fit the new form factor.

My teammate and good friend Garrett Marzo helped me and inspired me every step of the way.

Thank you everyone!
